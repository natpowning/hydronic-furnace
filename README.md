# HydronicFurnace
Arduino based controller for multi-zone and multi-source hydronic heating system.

## Current State
Fully functional for single thermostat and electric heat source.  Has been 
keeping S/V Junovia warm while moored in marinas during Pacific-Northwest winters
since 2018.

Currently, one problem regularly occurs tracked with Issue #1 which requires the 
thermal safety switch on the electric heater must be reset when it overheats after
shut down.
